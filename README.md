# 🎯 Project Name (Working Title)

A hobby-centric content creation platform focused on **quality of time**, not screen addiction.

---

## 📌 Overview

Most existing social media platforms are optimized to maximize user attention and screen time through infinite feeds and trend-driven algorithms. While effective for engagement, this approach often leads to passive consumption, distraction, and content fatigue.

This project aims to build an alternative.

The platform is designed for **passionate individuals and hobby creators**—dancers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, writers, and learners—who want a focused environment to **create, learn, and improve** without being overwhelmed by irrelevant or addictive content.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

The central idea is to move away from feed-based consumption and toward **intent-based interaction**.

- No infinite scrolling
- No generic trending feed
- No engagement-first algorithms

Instead, users actively choose **what they want to practice or learn**, and the system supports that intent with structured, niche-specific content.

---

## ✨ Key Goals

- Promote **deep engagement** over passive scrolling
- Encourage learning, practice, and skill development
- Provide creators a space to share **process, not just outcomes**
- Reduce cognitive overload and content fatigue
- Respect user time and attention

## 🧩 What Makes This Platform Different

| Conventional Platforms | This Platform |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Feed-driven | Intent-driven |
| Trend-based discovery | Interest-based discovery |
| Optimize time spent | Optimize quality of time |
| Generic content | Niche-specific content |

---

## 🎨 Supported Content Types (Examples)

- Dance choreography breakdowns  
- Camera handling and cinematography techniques  
- Music practice routines and exercises  
- Acting drills and script readings  
- Art workflows and step-by-step processes  

The platform is not limited to visual content and can expand to include **text, audio, structured lessons, and practice modules**.

---

## 👥 Target Users

- Hobby creators  
- Learners and practitioners  
- Artists, performers, and makers  
- Users seeking focused, meaningful content instead of endless feeds  

---

## 🚧 Project Status

**Early-stage development / ideation phase**

Current focus areas:
- Defining the product vision and principles
- Writing a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Designing system architecture and user flows
- Identifying a minimal yet meaningful MVP

Implementation will begin after requirements are finalized.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Tentative)

The technology stack will be finalized after the SRS phase.

- Frontend: To be decided  
- Backend: To be decided  
- Database: To be decided  

The stack will prioritize **scalability, simplicity, and maintainability**.

---

## 🔮 Future Vision

The long-term vision is to create a platform that functions more like a **digital practice space** than a traditional social network.

Planned future directions include:
- Personalized but **non-addictive** content discovery
- Structured learning paths for different hobbies
- Creator tools focused on teaching and mentorship
- Community spaces centered around improvement, not virality
- Time-aware design that encourages intentional usage
- Privacy-first and user-respecting design principles

Ultimately, the goal is to demonstrate that technology can be built to **serve human focus and creativity**, rather than exploit attention.
